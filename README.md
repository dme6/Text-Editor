# SimpleTextEditor
My first JAVA GUI based project based on Notepad.
This Editor has been designed on the basis of **Notepad**.
The functions that have been accomplished are -
- Saving and opening a text file with the extension **.txt**.
- Checking for Saved file and open/save operations before closing the Edior.
- Hotkeys and mnemonics added for various operations including opening/saving files, zoom etc.
- Font dialog box added that concern on fonts available on the particular machine operating the Editor.
